4. As many as 30 ingredients are part of the usual borscht!

5. Pork lard surpasses butter in terms of the amount of fatty acids necessary for the human body in its composition.

6. Do you think that we only have dumplings with cherries, cabbage or potatoes? Not at all! Ukrainian housewives fill them with mushrooms, beans, pumpkin, and even pineapples.

7. Our traditional kulish has been recognized as one of the excellent means for the prevention of oncological diseases.
